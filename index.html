<p>Born and raised during the dawn of Silicon Valley. The air then smelled of fruit orchards, tomato canneries and feed mills. Orchards and aerospace, another time and place. Some parts of the Valley have held onto that laid-back vibe of the 1970s and earlier. Hike the open-spaces and you'll still find it. Or come down off the hills into small town called Woodside where billionaires in pickups and Redwings try very, very hard to keep the old vibe going. The tech wealth today is phenomenal, disruptive, supplantive. The tsunami-like arrival of Silicon Valley, the rapid pace of old giving way to new.<p>


<p>I don't code, but I'd like to learn bit of my hometown's lingua franca. My jumping off point is <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/lectures">here</a>. My other interests include piano, photography, illustration, hiking and reading. My wife and I have shared the gift of friendship and love with a willful and charming 5 year old canine named Lucky. Lux sat shotgun for 40K miles on a year long roadtrip across the US and Canada. You can read about that trip <a href="http://2010flightofthechickadee.blogspot.com/">here</a>.</p>
