<a name="hi-my-name-is-mary-sievert" class="anchor" href="#hi-my-name-is-mary-sievert"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi, my name is Mary Sievert.</h3>

<p>Online, I like to use the name <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:pixtl">pixtl</a>. I am a visual artist, most of my academic training lead to a career in graphic and exhibit design. I added in photography and illustration as often as I could, and still do a little of all of those things. I enjoy making things with hand tools too, like wooden gates, fences and chairs, and small objects made of cast metal and carved stacked-wood laminates. I have a dog in my life and he's called Lucky. Or Lux. He joined my partner and I on a yearlong roadtrip which you can read about <a href="http://2010flightofthechickadee.blogspot.com/">here</a>. </p>

<p>GitHub Newbie. 
I've started this page to learn how to code. I'm keeping the original Markdown copy that populated this starter GitHub page. Later I'll be replacing it with my own Loren Ipsum, er, thoughts! I made my first table-based site in 2001 (macromedia's dreamweaver). Two other portfolio sites followed. In late 2009 I dropped my domain and took some time off (see above). I'm an introvert and struggle with the packaging formulas and insistence that <em>everyone</em> build, polish and animate a coherent and distictive public "brand" via social networking, cms blogs, etc. Things evolve, innovation is magic, but why is it a necessity for any artist to trade today's tools, for a newer set? Is disruption always good? Proprietary apps, SAAS offer upgrades ad infinitem, creativity is being forced to wear a price tag and feature list, meanwhile we are awash with information, media, tools and talent. It's fair to consider another option that sustains and nurtures creativity, where the artist reasserts ownership over their work, imagination and ideas. Art is art because of something freely shared and cultivated across cultures and generations: Craft + talent. Here at GitHub I'll be learning how to use tools developed with an open-source collaborative mindset. It already feels good to be here. Like the minimal elements of art: a room, newsprint, charcoal sticks, a model, and bright morning light. Maybe I can get by without ever having to sacrifice my time with that snaggle-tooth franken-language called css.</p>
