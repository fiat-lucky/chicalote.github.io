<a name="Made-in-Cupertino" class="anchor" href="#Made-in-Cupertino"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Growing up in Cupertino, I climbed cherry and apricot trees.</h3>
<p>Before Apple and Silicon Valley. The place smelled of fruit orchards and tomato canneries. The Cali Bros. elevator displayed a lighted tree on top during the winter holidays. Orchards and aerospace, another time and place. Some pockets of the valley maintain a laid-back vibe of the 1970s and earlier. Hike the open-spaces and you'll still find it. Or come down off the hills into small town called Woodside where billionaires in pickups and Redwings try very, very hard to keep the old vibe going. The tech wealth today is phenomenal, disruptive, supplantive. The tsunami-like arrival of Silicon Valley, the rapid pace of old giving way to new.<p>


<p>I don't code, but who knows what tomorrow will bring. Photography, illustration, hiking and reading are my joys. My wife and I share the gift of friendship and love with a willful and charming 5 year old canine named Lucky. Lux sat shotgun for 40K miles on a year long roadtrip across the US and Canada. You can read about that trip <a href="http://2010flightofthechickadee.blogspot.com/">here</a>.</p>
