<a name="hi-my-name-is-mary-sievert" class="anchor" href="#hi-my-name-is-mary-sievert"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi, my name is Mary Sievert.</h3>

<p>Born and raised in Cupertino preSilicon Valley era. Online, I like to use the name <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:pixtl">pixtl</a>. I am a visual artist, most of my academic training helped me carve out a career in graphic and exhibit design. I added in photography and illustration as often as I could, and still do a little of all of those things. I enjoy making things with hand tools too, like wooden gates, fences and chairs, and small objects made of cast metal and carved stacked-wood laminates. I have a dog, a Brittany we named Lucky. Or Lux. Lux joined my partner and I on a yearlong roadtrip which you can read about <a href="http://2010flightofthechickadee.blogspot.com/">here</a>. While growing up in the Santa Clara Valley of canneries and aerospace I watched cherry, plum and apricot orchards give way to tract homes, strip malls and fabs that in short order became the homes of today's knowledge workers, technology startups and internet giants. Recently I've been trying new things like learning to play jazz piano. I'd like learn how to code. I built my first table-based site back in 1999 using macromedia's dreamweaver. Two other table-based portfolio sites followed. In late 2009 I let my domain expire and took some time off (see above). </p>

<p>I'm an introvert and struggle with the packaging formulas and insistence that <em>everyone</em> build, polish and animate a coherent and distictive public "brand" via social networking, cms blogs, tweets, vining, iger likes and follows, etc. Innovation is a glory and even revolutionary, I think I'll always be thrilled by the chance to witness something new. hy is it a necessity for any artist to trade today's tools, for a newer set? Is disruption always good? Proprietary apps, SAAS offer upgrades ad infinitem, creativity is being forced to wear a price tag and feature list, meanwhile we are awash with information, media, tools and talent. It's fair to consider another option that sustains and nurtures creativity, where the artist reasserts ownership over their work, imagination and ideas. Art is art because of something freely shared and cultivated across cultures and generations: craft + talent. Here at GitHub I'll be learning how to use tools developed with an open-source collaborative mindset. It already feels good to be here. Like the minimal elements of art: a room, newsprint, charcoal sticks, a model, and bright morning light. Maybe I can get by without ever having to sacrifice my time with that snaggle-tooth franken-language called css.</p>
