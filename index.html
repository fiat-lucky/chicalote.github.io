<a name="hi-my-name-is-mary-sievert" class="anchor" href="#hi-my-name-is-mary-sievert"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi, my name is Mary Sievert.</h3>

<p>Online, I like to use the name <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:pixtl">pixtl</a>. I am a visual artist, most of my academic training helped me carve out a career in graphic and exhibit design. I added in photography and illustration as often as I could, and still do a little of all of those things. I enjoy making things with hand tools too, like wooden gates, fences and chairs, and small objects made of cast metal and carved stacked-wood laminates. My dog, Lucky shares his life with my wife and me. Lux joined us on a year long roadtrip across the US and Canada. You can read about that trip <a href="http://2010flightofthechickadee.blogspot.com/">here</a>. </p>

<p>While growing up in the Santa Clara Valley of canneries and aerospace I watched cherry, plum and apricot orchards give way to tract homes, strip malls and fabs that in short order became the homes of today's knowledge workers, technology startups and internet giants. Every time I return I see transformation and fewer remnants of the world I once knew so well. The pace, the wealth focus is conspicuous and phenomenal. Innovation is a glory and even revolutionary, I think I'll always be thrilled by the chance to witness the arrival of something new. I have deep roots that will remain attached to the valley, no matter how far it moves away from it's laid-back origins. Recently I've been exploring other channels of creativity, like learning to play jazz piano. I'm going to finally learn how to code. Here at GitHub I'll be learning how to use tools developed with an open-source collaborative mindset. It already feels good to be here. Like the minimal elements of art: a room, newsprint, charcoal sticks, a model, and bright morning light. Maybe I can get by without ever having to sacrifice my time with that snaggle-tooth franken-language called css.</p>
