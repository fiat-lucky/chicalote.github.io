<p>Born and raised during the dawn of Silicon Valley. The air then smelled of fruit orchards, tomato canneries and feed mills. Orchards and aerospace, another time and place. Some parts of the Valley have held onto that laid-back vibe of the 1970s and earlier. Hike the open-spaces and you'll still find it. Or come down off the hills into small town called Woodside where billionaires in pickups and Redwings try very, very hard to keep the old vibe going. The tech wealth today is phenomenal, disruptive, supplantive. The tsunami-like arrival of Silicon Valley, the rapid pace of old given way to new. I struggle to balance my shock and awe, to reconcile opposing emotions.<p>


<p>I don't yet code, but I've begun the journey <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/lectures">here<./a><p>

<p>This little site of mine is a GitHub Page. Thank you GitHub. Thank you to the orderedlist for your lovely <a href="https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal">Minimal</a>Theme. </p>I'm a visual learner and communicator: photography, logos and illustration. My wife and I enjoy the company of a 5 year old willful canine named Lucky. Lux joined us on a year long roadtrip across the US and Canada. You can read about that trip <a href="http://2010flightofthechickadee.blogspot.com/">here</a>. </p>
