{"name":"fotogwoofy.github.io","tagline":"FIAT LUX!","body":"### Hi, my name is Mary Sievert. \r\nOnline, I like to use the name [pixtl](https://pinboard.in/u:pixtl). I am a visual artist, most of my academic training lead to a career in graphic and exhibit design. I added in photography and illustration as often as I could, and still do a little of all of those things. I enjoy making things with hand tools too, like wooden gates, fences and chairs, and small objects made of cast metal and carved stacked-wood laminates. I have a dog in my life and he's called Lucky. Or Lux. He joined my partner and I on a yearlong roadtrip which you can read about [here](http://2010flightofthechickadee.blogspot.com/). \r\n\r\nGitHub Newbie. \r\nI've started this page to learn how to code. I'm keeping the original Markdown copy that populated this starter GitHub page. Later I'll be replacing it with my own Loren Ipsum, er, thoughts! I made my first table-based site in 2001 (macromedia's dreamweaver). Two other portfolio sites followed. In late 2009 I dropped my domain and took some time off (see above). I'm an introvert and struggle with the packaging formulas and insistence that _everyone_ build, polish and animate a coherent and distictive public \"brand\" via social networking, cms blogs, etc. Things evolve, innovation is magic, but why is it a necessity for any artist to trade today's tools, for a newer set? Is disruption always good? Proprietary apps, SAAS offer upgrades ad infinitem, creativity is being forced to wear a price tag and feature list, meanwhile we are awash with information, media, tools and talent. It's fair to consider another option that sustains and nurtures creativity, where the artist reasserts ownership over their work, imagination and ideas. Art is art because of something freely shared and cultivated across cultures and generations: Craft + talent. Here at GitHub I'll be learning how to use tools developed with an open-source collaborative mindset. It already feels good to be here. Like the minimal elements of art: a room, newsprint, charcoal sticks, a model, and bright morning light. Maybe I can get by without ever having to sacrifice my time with that snaggle-tooth franken-language called css.\r\n\r\n_October 15, 2013_\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
