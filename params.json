{"name":"Fotogwoofy.github.io","tagline":"PIXTL (Call Me Lucky)","body":"### Hello World\r\nYou just found my blog so I want to tell you right away that I'm happy you are here. I am starting this page so I can give GitHub and take my first steps into learning a bit about coding, UI design and meet other creative folks in the open source universe. For now I'm keeping the original Markdown copy that populates this page. Later I'll be replacing it with my own Loren Ipsum, er, thoughts!\r\n\r\n***\r\n_October 15, 2013_\r\n\r\nNewbie. Built my first table-based site in 2001 (macromedia's dreamweaver). 2 other portfolio sites followed before I dropped my domain and took some time off. I'm an introvert and fail to find a benefit (for me personally) to build \"my brand\" via social networking, cms blogs, etc. The creative model is broken. Proprietary apps and saas place a higher and higher price tag on creativity (we are awash with digital information, media, talent). Opting out, seeking to regain some ownership of what I make and imagine and dream. Refocusing, taking a step off the upgrade bandwagon.  Returning to classic artistic pursuits, trying out new things, mastering old tools. Craft + talent. Here at GitHub I'll be learning how to use tools developed with an open-source collaborative mindset. It already feels familiar. Like the minimal elements of art: a room, newsprint, charcoal sticks, a model, and bright morning light. Maybe, just maybe I'll get by without ever having to sacrifice my time with that snaggle-tooth franken-language called css.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
